# Tiny Vision Transformer (ViT)

The simplest implementation of a ViT you will find anywhere. Trained on CIFAR-10 with 4x4 image patches. For reference see the paper ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by Dosovitskiy et al.
